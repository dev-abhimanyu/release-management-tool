# Release Management Tool
<h2>Intro</h2>

Release Management Tool is a web application developed using **Node.js (Express, Express-NTLM, Mongoose, EJS), HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, Javascript** and **MongoDb**. The application aims to provide a unified platform to keep a track of releases and perform CRUD operations on release data. Another key feature of the application is to identify the "Coinciding Releases" so that the users can pay special attention to them in order to avoid release failure/multiple rollbacks. This feature is implemented through MongoDb aggregation.<br>
